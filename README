JIRA Mindmap Planner for Astah

JIRA Mindmap Planner for Astah provides a whole new way of agile project planning for your team. For release planning and iteration planning, a team breaks down epics, stories, tasks and issues and then assigns them to team members. To manage the project planning, JIRA shows them in a list, GreenHopper does in Kanban. Have you wished there were any other effective ways?

So we looked at the great possibilities of Mind Map and found a new value of it in a project planning which is a new visualizing way of tasks we propose, "Mindmap planning". With Mindmap planning, you can import issues from JIRA and map them into Mind Map. To assign them to team members, all you do is to drag & drop the issue branches under the assigner's branch.

You can also view the issues in different perspectives. For instance, if you want to see them in an iteration-base to see what issues the iteration holds, you can switch the view to "Iteration", if you want to see who has what issues, you can have a view of issues on assigned-member base, and Issue Type-base (Tasks, bugs, improvements) and others.

One of the great things about Mindmap, the bird view, can tell the balance of tasks in an iteration, process, load of assigned tasks per person visually at a glance. You can quickly catch overloading situation and to have the solutions before they turn into real problems.
